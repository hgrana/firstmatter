         <p>According to OWASP, cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack, in which malicious code is
            injected into formerly trusted sites. Vulnerabilities that allow these attacks to happen are popular and
            occur whenever an application fails to validate and/or encrypt a user data input to the system.
         </p>
         <p>An attacker can use XSS to send malicious code to an unsuspecting user. The user's browser
            final has no way of knowing if the code is trusted and executes it. In this way the malicious code can gain
            access
            to any cookies, tokens or sensitive user data that are stored by the affected browser. In some
            cases, the user may have the Document Object Model (DOM) altered, compromising the usability of the site
            and increasing the chances of invasion.
         </p>
         <h3>Types of XSS attacks</h3>
         <p>Stored or Persistent XSS (Type 1): Stored XSS occurs when malicious code is stored on the
            website server, in databases, logs, messages, comments field, etc.
         </p>
         <p>Reflected or Non-Persistent (Type 2) XSS: According to OWASP, Reflected XSS occurs when malicious code
            is stored outside the server, as in an error message, a search result, or any response that
            includes some kind of data that was sent to the server.
         </p>
         <p>DOM-based XSS (Type 0): DOM-based XSS occurs, according to OWASP, when the entire attack is done by the
            part of the user's interaction with the web application.
         </p>
         <h3>Impacts of Cross-site Scripting</h3>
         <p>Cross-site scripting is probably one of the most prevalent risks in web applications, and yet it is one of the
            most neglected. The main risks are associated with the fact that the user is directly affected by the
            invasion, being the main attack vector.
         </p>
         <p>One of the main attack vectors is the hijacking of legitimate accounts, usually the attacker manages to
            access by stealing the user's session cookie. This type of attack gives the attacker full access to
            everything that user has: private data and functionality only accessible to the user. This kind of
            attack can be conducted by placing scripts in vulnerable fields of the web application (XSS type 1).
         </p>
         <p>Another common attack vector is using HTML and JavaScript to steal user access information to
            Web application. This attack can be carried out by performing a part of social engineering with a false copy of
            the
            Web application login page along with an XSS vulnerability to be sent to victims. As
            in the case of account hijacking, the victim enters a page where the malicious code is executed showing a
            fake login screen. If the user tries to login, the access information will be sent to the server of the
            attacker, where he can use this information to gain access to the victim's account.<br>This tactic is the most
            beneficial to the attacker, being possible to obtain access data in plain text instead of a session cookie. One
            Extra attack vector includes using social engineering to persuade a victim to put access data into
            fake forms, which usually steals the victim's credentials.
         </p>
         <p>the damage caused by XSS in organizations can be diverse, apart from the damage caused by the attack itself and
            by
            others that use XSS as a basis for even more devastating attacks. A successful attack can impact the
            a company's users and employees, as well as its ability to generate income or output. even if one
            company has never suffered from XSS attacks, if the vulnerabilities are present in the web application, this
            can already be
            enough to impact the company's public relations, even more so if these vulnerabilities are published
            on information security portals or on news channels.
         </p>
         <h3>A Case Study</h3>
         <p>In 2005, a 19-year-old boy released the computer virus known as “Samy”. Maybe the virus
            fastest computer in history that changed Internet security forever.
         </p>
         <p>At the time, MySpace allowed the use of HTML code for user profile customization, which caused
            a serious flaw in the security of the system allowing an end user, with a few lines of code
            JavaScript, make unexpected changes to the platform. Although the virus spread quickly, it was
            harmless. The biggest impact of the virus was to show how websites at the time were misconfigured and exposed
            to
            vulnerabilities that the companies themselves were not aware of.
         </p>
         <p>At the time, approximately 80-90% of websites could suffer from some type of XSS attack according to OWASP.
            (2015). Protocols were created that could be followed to mitigate such risks and minimize such
            vulnerabilities. After 10 years, approximately 47% of websites may suffer from XSS attacks.
         </p>
         <h3>How to protect yourself?</h3>
         <p>OWASP provides numerous prevention lists for web applications, one of them being against XSS attacks and all
            its variations.

         <h2>Cobra, a game in JS</h2>

         <p>A few months ago I invested some time to improve some JS skills and in that period I developed a Space
            Invaders, a simple game that added a lot to my dynamics with the language.
         </p>
         <p>Recently I did the same, however, the game of the time is the famous Snake game.</p>
         <p>This time the game is simpler, but very fun to make and play, some puzzles on how to
            serpent is generated and how to make it walk.

         <h2>Space Invaders!</h2>

         <p>In the last few weeks, I've taken the time to study JS and combine the useful with the pleasant.</p>
         <p>To train some programming concepts I decided to make a very popular game, Space Invaders. I had
            several challenges that I don't normally face when I'm programming for data handling/metrics and
            information processing, such as how to know that the attacker was hit by your shot? How
            make the screen elements not pop out of the map?<br>It's questions like this that make the
            software development that take you out of your comfort zone much more interesting.
